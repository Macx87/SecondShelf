## 1. Abstract
The "Second-Hand Book Selling and Buying Platform" is a web-based solution developed as a final year college project. It addresses the need for students and readers to easily exchange used books in a secure, user-friendly environment. The system provides features like account creation, email OTP verification, book listing with rich metadata, and book browsing.

This platform is not intended for real-world transactions, but rather for showcasing technical and design capabilities in web application development. It aims to promote sustainable reading practices by facilitating book reuse in a digital space.

## 2. Introduction
Academic books can be costly, and many students seek ways to reduce expenses. Traditionally, exchanging second-hand books has involved informal means like group chats, bulletin boards, and word-of-mouth. These lack accountability, consistency, and reach.

This project fills that void by offering a centralized, organized digital platform for second-hand book exchange. Developed using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap, it also integrates PHPMailer for email functionality. With an intuitive interface and responsive design, it enhances accessibility and usability for students and educators.

## 3. Existing System
- No centralized platform focused solely on academic book exchange.
- Book trading mostly occurs on social media, messily and without moderation.
- Absence of verification or security measures.
- High chances of spam or misleading listings.

---

## 4. Proposed System
- User-friendly and secure web portal for listing and browsing books.
- Email-based OTP verification using PHPMailer.
- Form-based entry of book details with image upload.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap for mobile-friendliness.
- Personal dashboard/profile section to manage listings.
